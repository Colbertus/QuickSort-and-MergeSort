# QuickSort-and-MergeSort
This project performs both quicksort and mergesort on a set of doubles from an input file. The first line of the input file needs to contain the total number of doubles to be sorted while all of the following lines have the set of numbers to perform the sorts on. Should be able to download this project and run it on VS Code. This program also stores the total number of comparisons for each sorting algorithm at the bottom of each respected output file. But Quick Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that picks out a partition, in the case of my program the partition is the last element of the array, and recursively splits up the array, creates more partitions, and sorts based on those partitions until the entire array gets sorted. Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm that recursively splits up an array into twos, if possible, then switches the elements depending on the order. Once that operation is done the split-up pieces get put back together again or merged one could call it. This project was a part of my CS 317 class, Introduction to Design and Analysis of Algorithms.
